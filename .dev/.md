# Development Approach for the GenLayer Node

GenLayer is an innovative decentralized ledger platform designed to execute "Intelligent Contracts," which extend beyond traditional smart contracts by allowing natural language processing and web-based data access. Given its novel approach, GenLayer requires careful, foundational research to ensure that each component aligns with its goals and that we leverage best practices from both blockchain and distributed systems.

Since this concept is largely unexplored in the market, creating a robust, high-quality GenLayer Node requires a solid understanding of the whitepaper, alignment with development partners, and an incremental approach to building, testing, and optimizing each core functionality.

## Project Overview

| **Project Name** | GenLayer Node |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | A blockchain node to execute and manage Intelligent Contracts on the GenLayer network |
| **Primary Language** | Golang, Scripting  |
| **Primary Components** | RPC Server, GenVM, State Management, Consensus Communication, CLI |

**Collaborative Planning and High-Level Architecture Design**

- **Initial Knowledge Sharing**: Before diving into development, I would collaborate closely with the second developer to align our understanding of the whitepaper and discuss the architecture and responsibilities of each component in the GenLayer Node. This includes mapping out core components such as the RPC Server, GenVM (Virtual Machine), state management, and consensus communication.
- **Define Core Functionalities**: Break down the node’s essential tasks: managing state, processing intelligent contracts, communicating with the consensus layer, and interacting via the RPC server. Establishing these functionalities upfront ensures we have a shared vision of the node’s overall architecture.
- **Architecture Blueprint**: Together, we’d design a high-level architecture that identifies dependencies, separates responsibilities across modules, and considers scalability, maintainability, and performance. This plan will guide development and serve as a basis for structuring the code

## Getting Started

| Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Prerequisites** | Ensure Golang is installed (v1.20 or higher). Docker is recommended for containerized deployment. |
| **Installation** | Clone the repository and install dependencies by running `go mod tidy`. |
| **Configuration** | Customize `config.yaml` to set up RPC endpoints, ports, and other node-specific settings. |
| **Run the Node** | Start the node with `go run main.go` or use Docker with `docker-compose up`. |

## Project Structure

this part is done with the folders that I provide and each folder I give him .md file to explain each folder 

## Development Workflow

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **Start Development Server** | `go run main.go` |
| **Run All Tests** | `go test ./...` |
| **Build Docker Image** | `docker build -t genlayer-node .` |
| **Linting and Code Formatting** | `go fmt ./... && go vet ./...` |

## **Establishing Testing and Quality Control**

- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for each core component (e.g., RPC endpoints, state management, consensus layer interactions) to validate functionality in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Conduct integration tests to verify that modules work together correctly and that communication between them (e.g., between the node and consensus) is smooth.
- **Stress Testing and Optimization**: Run performance tests to evaluate the node’s ability to handle high transaction volumes and identify bottlenecks. Introduce optimizations where needed.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement tracing across modules to gain insight into performance and quickly pinpoint issues during testing and production.

| Type | Description | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Unit Tests** | Test individual modules, e.g., RPC, VM, State, etc. | `go test ./...` |
| **Integration Tests** | Ensure different modules communicate and operate correctly as a system. | `go test -tags=integration ./tests/integration` |
| **Stress Testing** | Evaluate the node’s performance under high load and concurrency. | `go run tests/stress_test.go` |

## **Deployment Preparation and Areas for Improvement**

- **Containerization**: Set up Docker for consistent deployments, allowing easy testing in different environments.
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)**: Automate build, test, and deployment processes to ensure that updates are frequent and reliable.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Integrate monitoring tools to track performance and detect issues in real time. This step is critical for production-readiness.
- **Scalability and Optimization**: Investigate potential improvements for node performance, resilience, and error handling as the node evolves.

| Environment | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **Local** | `go run main.go` |
| **Docker** | `docker-compose up` |
| **Kubernetes** | Use the provided Helm chart in `/deploy/k8s` for Kubernetes setup. |

## **Comprehensive Documentation and Clean Code Practices**

- **Internal Documentation**: Create inline comments, document module interfaces, and maintain README files for each component to support readability and maintainability.
- **User Guide and API Documentation**: Develop a user-facing guide on setting up, running, and interacting with the GenLayer Node. Document all available RPC calls, CLI commands, and configuration options.
- **Code Cleanliness**: Follow Golang best practices to keep the codebase clean, organized, and optimized for readability and efficiency.
