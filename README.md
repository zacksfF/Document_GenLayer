# GenLayer Docs

I have reviewed the GenLayer whitepaper and taken into account our previous discussions to develop a comprehensive plan for the GenLayer Node. This document outlines the approach for node development, the project structure, and collaboration strategies. It also identifies missing elements in the current roadmap and suggests improvements for scaling the node. The work is structured into different sections for better clarity and easier follow-up, ensuring we stay aligned as we move forward with development.

### README Structure:


- **Part 1: GenLayer Whitepaper and Chart Review**  
   A summarized review of the whitepaper, highlighting key aspects of the GenLayer Node architecture and components from the provided chart. (Link: [genlayer_paper_andChart_review](https://github.com/zacksfF/Document_GenLayer/tree/main/.genlayer_paper_andChart_review))

- **Part 2: Development Approach for the GenLayer Node**  
   - **Project Overview**: Brief introduction to the GenLayer Node development.
   - **Project Structure**: Overview of the folder structure and key modules.
   - **Development Workflow**: Steps to initiate development, including setting up the environment, version control, and collaboration tools.
   - **Testing and Quality Control**: Testing strategies, code reviews, and continuous integration (Link: [dev](https://github.com/zacksfF/Document_GenLayer/tree/main/.dev))

- **Part 3: Collaboration and Second Developer's Role**  
   Discuss the collaboration setup and how tasks will be divided between me and the second Go developer (Link: [second_Go_dev](https://github.com/zacksfF/Document_GenLayer/tree/main/.second_Go_dev)).

5. **Part 4: Improvement Tasks**  
   Identify what's missing in the current roadmap and suggest improvements or optimizations, particularly for scalability (Link: [improvement_tasks](https://github.com/zacksfF/Document_GenLayer/tree/main/.improvement_tasks)).
